Horiseon wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so their own site is optimized for search engines. To do this I had to review the current codebase and modify it to fit their needs. My changes are listed below:

- Renamed many Div elements to Semanctic HTML elements to ensure it flowed in a logical structure independant of styling and positioning.

- Renamed the folder Assets to assets for case sensativity to ensure all images and CSS files linked properly with the page.

- Added Alt attributes to all images and icons to ensure those utilizing reader assistance devices would be able to properly and effectively navigate the webapge. 

- Adjusted Header Elements so they fllowed in numberical order. 

- Renamed the Webpage to a concise, descripte title.

- Adjusted the CSS file and added comments to make it easier for others to understand if parts of the styling on the webpage need modified at a later date.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.
