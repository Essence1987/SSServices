To impress clients, you should always exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, check that all links are functioning correctly. You can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Horiseon wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so their own site is optimized for search engines. To do this I had to review the current codebase and modify it to ensure the following took place.

- Renamed Div to Semanctic HTML elements to ensure it flowed in a logical structure independant of styling and positioning.

- Renamed the folder Assets to assets for case sensativity to ensure all images and CSS files linked properly with the page.

- Added Alt attributes to all images and icons to ensure those utilizing reader assistance devices would be able to properly and effectively navigate the webapge. 

- Adjusted Header Elements so they fllowed in numberical order. 

- Renamed the Webpage to a concise, descripte title.

- Adjusted comments to the CSS file to make it easier for others to understand if parts of the styling on the webpage need modified at a later date.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.
